The non-subscribing Guard Encryption Service recipient’s and user's ability to use the Guard Encryption Service is
 conditioned upon the non-subscribing Guard Encryption Service user having Internet web access and the ability to support specific secure web sessions including, but not limited to, a compatible Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

d. Further Access and Usage Limits. Network Solutions, at any time and in its sole discretion, may restrict or modify: (a) the size of an electronic message that the Guard Encryption Service will encrypt or decrypt; and (b) the number of recipient decryptions (i.e., the number of times a recipient decrypts your encrypted message) for the messages you encrypt with the Guard Encryption Service in a given time period. Network Solutions, at any time and in its sole discretion, may further restrict or modify the Guard Encryption Service's ability to encrypt and decrypt messages in order to maintain the quality of our services and to protect our computer systems.
